// in jQuery, if you want to select elements that have a certain class, you use $('.CLASS_NAME')
// here, we are asking for all links (A tags) that are descendents (contained within)
// elements with the class "steps"
// we are then adding an event handler for the "click" event of each of these links
$('.steps a').click(function(e) {
  // "this" (without quotes) refers to the element that was clicked on
  // so, when a user clicks on one of these links, that link is hidden
  $(this).hide();
  // since each of these links is an anchor link (with a #) referring to another element on the page,
  // we can simply use the link's hash (the part of the href beginning with the "#") as an id selector
  // so, we are asking for the element with an id matching the link's hash, then showing it
